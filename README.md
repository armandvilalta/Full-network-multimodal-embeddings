# Full-network-multimodal-embeddings
Code used in the paper: Studying the Impact of the Full-Network Embedding on Multimodal Pipelines (currently under review)

Similar to [visual-semantic-embedding](https://github.com/ryankiros/visual-semantic-embedding) and  [order-embedding] https://github.com/ivendrov/order-embedding) of which this repository is a fork, 
we map images and their captions into a common vector space.

This version adds the max loss option from F. [Faghri, D.J. Fleet, J.R. Kiros and S. Fidler, VSE++: Improving Visual-Semantic Embeddings with Hard Negatives,
arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.05612 (2017).](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05612)
